# üîó Deno URL Shortener with Firebase RTDB:

A simple and lightweight URL shortener built with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database).

> At the beginning, it was my first project using Deno to build a REST API. I kept adding features, and now I'm sharing it publicly on my GitHub.

> I haven't picked a real name for the project yet, so I just called it: `nde-shortener`.

## üì¶ Features:

- Security comes first: secrets are stored in a `.env` file, with multiple validations performed before transmission.
- Generate short unique codes for URLs (avoid collisions).
- Redirect users to original URLs.
- Store mappings in Firebase Realtime Database.
- Minimal and fast REST API.
- Written in TypeScript with Deno runtime.
- `is_verified` and `delete` actions implemented.

## üõ° GDPR Compliance:

This project is designed with **GDPR compliance** in mind:

- ‚ùå No IP addresses or personal data are stored.  
- ‚ùå No logging of user activity.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic rate limiting is implemented using **hashed IP addresses**:  
  - Hashes are used **only in-memory**, not persisted or stored in any database.  
  - IP hashes are discarded on server restart.  
- ‚úÖ No tracking, cookies, or analytics.

This ensures that no identifiable user data is collected, stored, or shared in any form.

## üß∞ Tech Stack:

- **Deno** ‚Äì TypeScript runtime.
- **Firebase RTDB** ‚Äì Realtime database for storing URLs.
- **Fetch API** ‚Äì Used for HTTP requests to Firebase.
