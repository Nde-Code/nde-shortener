# 🛠️ A Cloudflare Workers-compatible version of the project:

This branch contains source code compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

> For those who don't know what Cloudflare Workers and edge computing are, take a look at: [https://workers.cloudflare.com/](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Nde-Code/nde-shortener&branch=cf-workers)

> Make sure that if you use this, Cloudflare has created a KV namespace and allows you to set environment variables. Read the documentation before using this widget.

The project is now hosted at [https://nsh.nde-code.workers.dev/](https://nsh.nde-code.workers.dev/), and the updated privacy policy can be found at [privacy.md](privacy.md).

# 🚀 To begin working with this version:

## 1. Create or login to your cloudflare account: [https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)

## 2. Install Node.js and npm (I've used [Volta](https://volta.sh/Volta) on [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)): [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## 3. Install the Wrangler CLI using:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

> If you haven't installed Wrangler globally, you'll need to prefix commands with `npx`, like `npx wrangler`.

## 4. Clone the project branch:
```bash
git clone --branch cf-workers --single-branch https://github.com/Nde-Code/nde-shortener.git
```

## 5. Log your Wrangler CLI to your Cloudflare account using:
```bash
wrangler login
```
> Make sure to do this securely on a trusted network.

## 6. Setting up the configuration:

First, create the `wrangler.jsonc` file, which contains the full configuration for your project. It should look like this:
```jsonc
{
	"name": "project_name",
	"main": "main.ts",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-10-08",
	"preview_urls": false,
	"observability": {
		"enabled": true,
		"head_sampling_rate": 1,
		"logs": {
			"invocation_logs": false
		},
		"traces": {
			"enabled": false
		}
	},
	"kv_namespaces": [
		{
			"binding": "YOUR_KV_NAME",
			"id": "YOUR_KV_ID"
		}
	]
}
```

### Main elements:

#### **`name`**

Defines the **name of your Worker project**.
This determines the public URL for your Worker on Cloudflare (for example:
`https://project_name.username.workers.dev`).

#### **`main`**

Specifies the **entry point** of your Worker script.
This is the file that exports your main fetch handler.

#### **`compatibility_date`**

Locks your Worker to a specific version of the Cloudflare Workers runtime.
This ensures your code continues to work as expected, even if Cloudflare updates the runtime.

#### **`preview_urls`**

It’s used to create a previewable URL. That’s a feature in Cloudflare Workers, but it’s not really useful for a small project. Feel free to take a look at: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/previews/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/previews/)

### Observability:

#### **`observability.enabled`**

When set to `true`, enables **automatic metrics and logs collection** for your Worker.
This lets you monitor performance and errors in the Cloudflare dashboard.

#### **`observability.head_sampling_rate`**

Defines the **percentage of requests sampled for tracing** (from `0` to `1`).

* `1` = 100% of requests are sampled (useful for debugging).
* `0.1` = 10% of requests are traced (better for production environments).

#### **`observability.logs.invocation_logs`**

Controls whether **automatic invocation logs** are collected for each Worker execution.

* `true` (default) = Cloudflare logs metadata like request method, URL, headers, and execution details.
* `false` = Disables automatic logs, keeping only your custom `console.log` entries.

> Disabling invocation logs is recommended for **GDPR compliance**, as it prevents Cloudflare from storing potentially sensitive request data.

#### **`observability.tracing.enabled`**

Controls whether **distributed tracing** is enabled for your Worker.

* `true` = Enables tracing spans and trace IDs for each request (requires compatible tracing backend).
* `false` = Disables tracing entirely.

> Tracing is disabled by default. If you're not using OpenTelemetry or a tracing system, leave this off to reduce data collection.

### KV Namespaces:

#### **`kv_namespaces`**

Binds your Worker to your **Cloudflare KV (Key-Value)** namespace.

Create a Workers KV via the dashboard or using:
```bash
wrangler kv namespace create YOUR_KV_NAME
```

> If you feel stuck, take a look at: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/get-started/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/get-started/)

And complete the `wrangler.jsonc` file with the following configuration:

* **`binding`** → The variable name you’ll use inside your code (here: `YOUR_KV_NAME`).
* **`id`** → The unique namespace ID from your Cloudflare dashboard.

### Environment Variables:

To start working **locally** with environment variables, create a file called `.dev.vars` and add the following content:

```env
FIREBASE_HOST_LINK="YOUR_FIREBASE_URL"
FIREBASE_HIDDEN_PATH="YOUR_SECRET_PATH"
HASH_KEY="THE_KEY_USED_TO_HASH_IPS"
ADMIN_KEY="THE_ADMIN_KEY_TO_DELETE_AND_VERIFY"
```

**List of variables in this project:**

| Variable               | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FIREBASE_HOST_LINK`   | The public or private Firebase endpoint used by your Worker.          |
| `FIREBASE_HIDDEN_PATH` | A hidden or secure subpath for sensitive Firebase operations.         |
| `HASH_KEY`             | The cryptographic key used to hash user IPs or sensitive identifiers. |
| `ADMIN_KEY`            | A private admin key used to verify or delete data.          |

When you have finished, **make sure there are no traces of secrets** in your code, and run the following command.  
*(Normally, you'll only need to do this once, when you first create the project.)*

```bash
wrangler secret put FIREBASE_HOST_LINK
wrangler secret put FIREBASE_HIDDEN_PATH
wrangler secret put HASH_KEY
wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY
```

# 🔧 Code adjustments for Wrangler compatibility:

Cloudflare Workers use the V8 isolate engine called [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) to run applications. They don’t use traditional Node.js runtimes like Deno, Node.js, or Bun under the hood. Cloudflare Workers runtime is based on something similar to `Deno` (thanks to Web APIs), so it's easy to edit and adjust your code to make it compatible. Therefore, to make this project compatible, every use of `Deno.*` must be replaced with an equivalent API that works in the Cloudflare Workers environment.

This section explains how the code was transformed to be compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

## 1. First of all, initialize TypeScript types

To benefit from TypeScript definitions in your editor and avoid compilation errors, you can add the Cloudflare Workers type definitions by running:

```bash
wrangler types
```

> Be sure that your `wrangler.jsonc` is correctly configured before running this command.

⚠️ **Note:** Cloudflare mentions that you can share this file with others: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/).  
However, I once checked this file before committing and found secrets inside (may be due to a mistake I made), so be cautious when planning to share it.

and put in `tsconfig.json`: 

> already done, if you've cloned the project so you don't need to do that.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true,
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Node",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "types": ["./worker-configuration.d.ts"]
  },
  "include": ["utilities", "worker-configuration.d.ts", "main.ts", "config.ts", "types"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

Here's a brief summary of what the `tsconfig.json` file do:

* **`noEmit: true`**
  Prevents TypeScript from emitting compiled JS files locally. The build and bundling is handled by **Wrangler/esbuild**, so this is only for type checking.

* **`allowImportingTsExtensions: true`**
  Allows importing `.ts` files directly, which is required for Deno-style and relative imports.

* **`target: "ES2020"`**
  Uses modern JavaScript syntax supported by the Worker runtime.

* **`lib: ["ES2020", "DOM"]`**
  Includes modern JS features (`ES2020`) and standard Web APIs (`DOM`) like `fetch`, `Request`, and `Response`.

* **`module: "ESNext"`**
  Uses ES Modules, which is the standard for Workers and modern TypeScript projects.

* **`moduleResolution: "Node"`**
  Tells TypeScript/IDE how to resolve modules.

  * Not strictly needed for relative `.ts` imports (they work anyway).
  * Useful if you later add npm packages: TypeScript and VS Code will correctly locate modules.
  * Does **not affect the final bundle**; esbuild handles module resolution.

* **`strict: true`**
  Enables all strict type checking options for safer, more predictable code.

* **`esModuleInterop: true`**
  Facilitates interoperability with CommonJS modules if needed.

* **`skipLibCheck: true`**
  Skips type checking for `.d.ts` files in dependencies to speed up compilation.

* **`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true`**
  Prevents file casing errors across different operating systems.

* **`types: ["./worker-configuration.d.ts"]`**
  Includes type definitions for Wrangler bindings (KV, R2, Durable Objects, ...).

* **`include`**
  Files/folders that TypeScript will type check: project source code and types.

* **`exclude`**
  Ignored folders: build artifacts (`dist`), dependencies (`node_modules`).

This project doesn't rely on any external libraries or dependencies, so there's no `package.json` or npm-related files.

## 2: Merge original Deno source code to make it Wrangler-compatible:

Let's briefly summarize how the code was adapted for compatibility with Cloudflare Workers.

### 1. The `.serve()` method needs to be replaced:
```ts
Deno.serve(handler);
```
by:
```ts
export default {

	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {

		return handler(req, env);

	}

};
```
### 2. Create an `Env` type (feel free to check: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/)):
```ts
 export interface Env {

    FIREBASE_HOST_LINK: string;

    FIREBASE_HIDDEN_PATH: string;

    ADMIN_KEY: string;

    HASH_KEY: string;

    RATE_LIMIT_KV: KVNamespace;
    
}
```

in the `types/types.ts` file, define your types and import them into `main.ts`.
Then, set your variables inside the `handler` function with `env`:

```ts
async function handler(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {

    config.FIREBASE_URL = env.FIREBASE_HOST_LINK ?? "";

    config.FIREBASE_HIDDEN_PATH = env.FIREBASE_HIDDEN_PATH ?? "";

    config.ADMIN_KEY = env.ADMIN_KEY ?? "";

    config.HASH_KEY = env.HASH_KEY ?? "";

    // ...

}
``` 

Then remove `Deno.env.get(...)` and replace it with `""` in `config.ts` (see it [here](config.ts)).

### 3. The `utilities/rate.ts` file is the only one that **has been completely rewritten**.  
You likely won't need to make any further changes to it.  
If you'd like to review it, you can find it here: [utilities/rate.ts](utilities/rate.ts).
To complete, replace each of the following lines:
```js
if (!(await checkTimeRateLimit(hashedIP)))
if (!(await checkDailyRateLimit(hashedIP)))
```

by:
```js
if (!(await checkTimeRateLimit(hashedIP))) // It's the same, it doesn't change.
if (!(await checkDailyRateLimit(env.YOUR_KV_NAME, hashedIP)))
```

and make sure to replace `YOUR_KV_NAME` with the value you specified for this field in the `wrangler.jsonc` file.

The anti-spam rate limiting works with the edge cache.  
Feel free to check out the documentation for more details:

  - [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/)

  - [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/cache-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/cache-api/)

  - [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-the-cache-works/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-the-cache-works/)
 
### 4. To retrieve the IP address in Cloudflare Workers, use the following code:
```ts
const ip: string = req.headers.get("cf-connecting-ip") ?? "unknown";
```

Instead of using the value from the `connInfo: Deno.ServeHandlerInfo` parameter:

```ts
const ip: string = (connInfo.remoteAddr.transport === "tcp") ? connInfo.remoteAddr.hostname : "unknown";
```

> You can check: [https://community.cloudflare.com/t/ip-address-of-the-remote-origin-of-the-request/13080/3](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/ip-address-of-the-remote-origin-of-the-request/13080/3) for more information.

# 📌 Run the project and deploy it:

To run locally, run:

```bash
wrangler dev
```

> If everything works correctly, that indicates your code is now compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

To bundle the project **(optional)**, run:

```bash
wrangler build
```

And in the end, to deploy in the Workers network, run:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

and your project is now deployed and accessible to anyone with the link.
